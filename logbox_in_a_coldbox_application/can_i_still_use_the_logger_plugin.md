# Can I still use the Logger plugin?

Yes, of course. The Logger plugin (v 3.0.0 > only) has been reconfigured to work with LogBox. You can use it like any normal Logger plugin with some added methods to it. In summary, the Logger plugin is configured to work via one logger who's category name is the name of your application.
