# LogBox from the ColdBox Proxy
The ColdBox proxy object also has three utility methods you can use to talk to LogBox from any remote proxy you create:

* <i>getLogBox()</i> : Get a reference to the LogBox instance.
* <i>getRootLogger()</i> : Get a reference to the root logger.
* <i>getLogger(category:any)</i> : Get a named logger instance or reference.
